As and when I will develop a project/mini project in python, I will upload it here for the following reason(s): 

i. as a reference to people who are working on similar project(s)

ii. for others to take new ideas about their upcoming/undergoing project(s)

iii. for my personal records & to keep my work safe & easily accessible.


Besides this, I might also upload some python programs which aren't any project, but those programs were written by me in python to either:

i. understand a concept in python or

ii. to practice a concept in python.

My files may not be that useful to experienced people/laterals in the field of software development, but I anticipate beginners will definitely get help/new ideas from my files as how to go about in their projects.

I will soon make a repositories containing my previous projects in C & Java.

Hope it helps you.
